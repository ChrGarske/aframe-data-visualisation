# VR Data Visualisation

Quick overview of the implementation so far of the data visualisation in [AFRAME](https://aframe.io).

Functionalities:
 - **Show Button**: show axis (x,y,z) buttons and the 2D plot area.
 - **Hide Button**: hide all buttons except for **show** and **hide** (wip)
 - **x axis button**: show variable buttons for data loaded in the scene for the x axis
 - **y axis button**: show variable buttons for data loaded in the scene for the y axis
 - **z axis button**: show variable buttons for data loaded in the scene for the z axis as well as the rotation for each axis and the center button to reverse any rotation. The plot area extends to a 3D plot area that can be rotated by the *<* and *>* buttons along the corresponding axes.
